When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I have a coherent group of information finished

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because I can update when there is a significant change.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is a copy of a repository that is stored in GitHub web. I can use to make changes and experiment without afecting the original.

A clone is a copu of an online repository stored in my local computer. It can be used for personal uses, not to collaborate as it is not online like the fork. 

A branch can be part of a fork or a clone, can be local or remote.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
It is a good way to avoid conflicts as it helps you to work from the last version

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

I would keep my copy of the web-files I would upload a duplicate on somewhere like Dropbox, send an e-mail to the people I want to collaborate. Git needs time to learn, it is harder than I thought. So at first its difficult and needs more time. But, after a time if everybody knows Git and GitHub you probably are faster and more efficient.
